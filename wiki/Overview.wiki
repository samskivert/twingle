#summary An overview of Twingle

Twingle is a collection of interacting components. Twingle is a library that JVM-based applications can use to access Your Data. Twingle is a Query Server that publishes an XML-RPC API for querying and browsing Your Data. Twingle is an HTTP Server that serves a web-based client for querying and browsing Your Data. Twingle is a Spider Server that periodically runs Spiders which collect Your Data and incorporate it into the Database, and also publishes an XML-RPC API for external injection of Your Data into Twingle by Firefox Extensions or other Twingle-aware applications.

Twingle wants to know all of Your Data, but time and energy are finite, so its programmers have to prioritize. Twingle aims to obtain data from the following sources:

  * IMAP email
  * Browser history (via file system scanning to start, Firefox extension later)
  * Browser bookmarks (")
  * Twitter feed
  * Facebook email and friend status feed
  * Instant Messenger history (via file system scanning to start, ? later)
  * RSS feeds (blogs that you read)
  * Delicious bookmarks
