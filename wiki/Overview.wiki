#summary An overview of Twingle

Twingle is a collection of interacting components. Twingle is a library that JVM-based applications can use to access Your Data. Twingle is a Query Server that publishes an XML-RPC API for querying and browsing Your Data. Twingle is an HTTP Server that serves a web-based client for querying and browsing Your Data. Twingle is a Spider Server that periodically runs Spiders which collect Your Data and incorporate it into the Database, and also publishes an XML-RPC API for external injection of Your Data into Twingle by Firefox Extensions or other Twingle-aware applications.

= Data Sources =

Twingle wants to know all of Your Data, but time and energy are finite, so its programmers have to prioritize. Twingle aims to obtain data from the following sources:

  * IMAP email
  * Browser history (via file system scanning to start, Firefox extension later)
  * Browser bookmarks (")
  * Twitter feed
  * Facebook email and friend status feed
  * Instant Messenger history (via file system scanning to start, ? later)
  * RSS feeds (blogs that you read)
  * Delicious bookmarks
  * SMS messaging (would be awesome, is such a thing possible?)
