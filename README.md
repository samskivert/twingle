## Twingle

Twingle absorbs and processes all of Your Data and exposes it in searchable semi-structured form,
accessible via a web interface and integratable with other applications.

Twingle receives Your Data (email, browser history and bookmarks, Facebook conversations, Twitter
messages, IM conversations, blogs, etc.) indexes all of the text in it, identifies the people that
are involved, important dates, and any other important Metadata we can identify and exports it back
in a searchable and browsable format.

Twingle has a web interface that allows you to search Your Data, browse through it by sorting and
filtering on the Metadata and visualize it in fun, if not especially useful ways.

## Status

Twingle is currently just a twinkle in the eye of a few excited programmers, so come back later if
you're looking for cold hard software.

You can read our [Twingle Overview](Overview) to get an idea of where we're going and how we're
getting there.

## Technology

Twingle is being implemented in [Scala](http://scala-lang.org/), though we aim to provide libraries
usable by any JVM language and XML-RPC APIs to make Your Data accessible to other programs that
wish to interoperate with Twingle.
