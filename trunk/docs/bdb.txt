Twingle is fiddling with BerkeleyDB as a possible persistent store.

Download BerkeleyDB 4.7.25 from:

http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/berkeley-db/db/index.html

Unpack, build, and install as:

% tar xzf db-4.7.25.tar.gz
% cd db-4.7.25/build_unix
% ../dist/configure --enable-java
% make
% make install

This will install into /usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.7 by default, you can
use --prefix with configure to change destination directory.

You will need to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or on MacOS,
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH) to the install directory's lib/ directory, e.g.:

% export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.7/lib

Alternatively we can add bdb.home to build.properties and fiddle ant
to set java.library.path which appears to require some special
incantations.  The above was faster for initial rudimentary testing
antics.

Top level docs are in db-4.7.25/docs/index.html, see "Java" under
"Getting Started with Data Storage" for a good overview of everything,
and in particular "Part II: Programming with the Base API".

Javadoc API docs are under db-4.7.25/docs/java/index.html.
